# SwapCard

TEAM Name - SEDLAB
PROJECT Name/Application - SWAPCARD

Several gift cards are given out each year and go unused because the recipient doesnâ€™t shop at the retailer that the card is with for products or services. To address this, SWAPCARD will provide gateway that allows recipients of gift cards to trade them with other recipients for retailers they are most likely to shop with.

The site will allow users to create accounts, and trade with other members. They will be able to rate their transactions, and leave comments. The site will host multiple retailers that offer gift cards, such as Starbucks, Home Depot, etc.
